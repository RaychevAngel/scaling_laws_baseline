# Active Context & Scratchpad

## Project Goal
Baseline for evaluating reasoning models using in-context search vs. standard search on a generalized Game of 24, using MCTS and SmolM2 models.

## Current Task
- Set up Python environment using `uv`.
- Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

## Next Steps
- Verify installation and environment.
- Investigate potential bugs mentioned by the user.
- Explore the codebase (`run.py`, `train/`, `evaluate/`).

## TODOs & Reminders
- Check CUDA compatibility for H100 if PyTorch/JAX are used (likely specified in requirements or needed manually).
- Configure `git` user.name and user.email.
- Set up pre-commit hooks if not already present.
